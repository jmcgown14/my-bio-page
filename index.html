    <p>Hello! I am an outgoing individual who laughs easily and enjoys spending time with family and friends.
        I have a 2 year old cat named Walter. I enjoy reading, going on hikes, cooking, and sleeping.
        I moved to Denver 5 years ago but I still think of Kansas as home. I am a quick learner and love being
        able to learn new things all the time.
    </p>
